what is yocto ?
```
 Yocto is a tool to create your own custom Linux operating system
```
what is a custom linux os?
```
A Custom Linux OS means a Linux operating system that you build or modify yourself, so it includes only the features you need
```

ðŸ”§ Why Build a Custom Linux OS?
```
Because for embedded systems (like IoT, robots, or cars), you donâ€™t need a full OS like Ubuntu.
You need:
Smaller size
Faster performance
Specific drivers
Better security
Full control
```

This diagram gives a high-level overview of how the Yocto Project is used to build custom Linux system images for embedded systems (like a custom board or SoC module). Here's a step-by-step explanation of whatâ€™s happening:

ðŸ”§ Yocto Project Overview:
Yocto is not an embedded Linux distribution itself, but a build system and set of tools that allows you to create custom Linux distributions for embedded devices.

ðŸ§± Diagram Breakdown:
1. Source Code
You start with source code â€” this includes kernel source, drivers, bootloader, libraries, apps, etc.

This is written by the developer or pulled from open source projects.

2. Build System (Yocto Build System)
This is the heart of the process and contains:

a. Build Engine
The core engine that coordinates the entire build.

Uses BitBake (a task executor) to process recipes (instructions on how to build packages
BitBake is the build tool at the core of the Yocto Project.
You can think of it like Make or CMake, but specialized for building full Linux systems (kernel, bootloader, libraries, applications, etc.) in a customizable and automated way.

Process recipes" means BitBake reads the build instructions 
Executing a series of instructions (called recipes) that define how to fetch, configure, compile, and package software components.
The build engine reads metadata and configurations.

b. Toolchain (Compiler)
Cross-compilation tools (like GCC for ARM or RISC-V).

Converts source code into binaries for the target embedded architecture.

c. OpenEmbedded Layer
Yocto uses OpenEmbedded metadata layers to organize components.

Contains configuration files, classes, and recipes to build different packages.

 The Build System takes the source code and compiles it using the toolchain under control of BitBake.

3. Output Folder (Binaries)
All compiled binaries are saved here.

Includes kernel images, root filesystem, bootloader binaries, etc.

4. System Image(s)
A System Image is created from the binaries.

This image is what runs on the target embedded hardware (e.g., .img, .bin, .elf files).

Can be written to SD card, eMMC, or directly flashed.

5. Target Hardware (Embedded Board)
This is the physical device onto which the software or firmware is deployed and executed.
Deploy = Install and run the software on a server or platform so that users can access it.
The image is loaded onto the embedded board (as shown on the right).

Example: Rockchip, Raspberry Pi, or custom SoC.

6. Terminal Output (Debugging)
The terminal at the bottom represents:
This refers to the console output used for monitoring and debugging the build and runtime behavior of the system.

Logs from the build system (useful for debugging build errors).

Serial/SSH output from the board for runtime debugging.


ðŸ”„ Flow Summary:
Write or gather source code.

Use Yocto's build system (BitBake + OpenEmbedded + Toolchain) to compile it.

Get output binaries.

Generate a custom Linux system image.

Load it onto embedded hardware.

Test/debug via the terminal/console
